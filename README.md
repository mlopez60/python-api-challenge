# python-api-challenge

This challenge tested my abilities to utilize APIS to grab data and make maps from data. 


Part1:
WeatherPy consisted of using the OpenWeatherMapAPI to retrieve weather data from random cities
Using this data, I created various scatter plots to show correlations between different weather effects. 

Part 2:
VacationPy consisted of using the cities found in Part 1, creating Maps using hvplots, and utlizing geoapify to map said cities. 
Next step was to narrow down the data to specific weather that I like, and then find the nearest hotels to those cities. 
We then remapped these cities.
